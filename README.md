NORMALIZATION
On the AUTOMOBILES DEALERS we have tried to normalize upto 3rd normal form.
1NF- obtained 1NF from making one value per cell ie one value for each attributes.
2NF- obtained 2NF from reducing partial functional dependency from making 2 tables namely dealers name and maker table.
3NF- obtained 3NF from reducing transitive dependency on zipcode and city by making a separate table zip-city table.
